<img width="1280" height="720" alt="preview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1a98a0c-abce-4c1f-91bd-b86e122e384f" />


Theme for **muOS** based on **PS Black** created by **[VagueParade](https://github.com/VagueParade)**.

This is a fork adapted with two main goals:

- **1280x720 Resolution** – Developed specifically for the **TrimUI Smart Pro**.
- **Brazilian Portuguese Interface** – Full translation of the theme, done by a native speaker, to make the experience more natural and accessible to the Brazilian community.
